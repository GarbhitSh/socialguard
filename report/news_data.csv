 content=People in Delhi are used to seeing their city top all kinds of charts for the wrong reasons. But when it comes to one of the most dangerous types of air pollutants – PM10 or Particulate Matter 10 – residents of India’s capital city can breathe easy, literally. A clutch of cities from the eastern part of India dominate the list of cities most affected by PM10 pollution.PM10 measures the amount of inhalable (large) dust particles in the air. It is different from the more well-known PM2.5, often called ‘fine dust’ to distinguish it from PM10, which – for lack of a better term – can be called ‘larger dust’.Asthma and lung cancer are only two of the deleterious effects of inhaling too much PM10..Now, let’s come back to the question of which city is the most polluted.According to Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change records, Jharia in the state of Jharkhand has the distinction of being the worst affected by the PM10 problem in India. With Particulate Matter emission (PM10) concentration of 281 μg/m3, Jharia is the most polluted city in India, according to data presented in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. In fact, all the top five polluted cities belong to eastern India - Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam.The second most polluted city in India is Brynihat in Assam. Very close to Jharia’s air quality, this city has a PM10 concentration of 257 μg/m3. The next three cities in the list of ‘top 5’ belong to Bihar, starting with Saharsa with a PM10 concentration of 250 μg/m3. It is followed by Katihar with a PM10 concentration of 227 μg/m3, and Samastipur with PM10 concentration of 220 μg/m3. .Interestingly, the city that is on everybody’s lips when air pollution is mentioned – Delhi – is not part of the top 5 list. The city had an average PM10 concentration of 205 μg/m3 as per data published by Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas (CAQM) in 2023. The reason for the high reading in these eastern Indian cities was not disclosed by the ministry, but is likely related to the extensive mining and industrial activity in the region. For example, Jharia is reportedly the “heartland of India’s coal industry” with more than 20 underground mines and several large open-cast mines. Jharia has also been witnessing persistent fires in the coal mines which have claimed several lives and have been posing threat to the residents of the town. Byrnihat in Assam, the second in the list, is home to several industries, which has ensured the hill city a place in the list. No. 3 on the list, Saharsa, is also home to several types of industries including brick manufacturing, jute and paper. .So, just how dangerous is PM10?According to the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the standard for average exposure to polluted air particles over 24 hours is 150 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA standard for average annual exposure is 50 micrograms per cubic meter.At moderate PM10 levels i.e, 51-100 μg/m3 over 24 hours the polluted air can cause breathing discomfort to people with lung diseases such as asthma. It can also cause discomfort to the general public.Meanwhile, at higher than the standard levels, i.e, 101-150 μg/m3 over 24 hours, the polluted air can lead to respiratory symptoms and breathing difficulty in people with lung disease, older adults and children. At very unhealthy levels, 151-250 μg/m3 over 24 hours, the polluted air can lead to   significant increase in respiratory effects and even premature mortality in people with lung disease and older adults. In addition to this, living in cities with highly polluted air can significantly increase respiratory diseases  in the general public.Long term exposure to PM10 is also  known to cause lung cancer.  .Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest,

 description=On Tuesday, Hajipur emerged as the most polluted city in India with a severe AQI of 427, contributing to alarming air quality levels in Bihar. Patna, Rajgir, and other cities in the state also ranked among the top 10 polluted cities. Discover the causes and potential solutions to this growing environmental issue.,
 content=Patna: With a ""severe"" air quality index (AQI) of 427, Hajipur was the most polluted city in the country on Tuesday, even as five more Bihar cities, including capital Patna and Rajgir, were in the top 10 list.Apart from Hajipur — the only city in the country to record an AQI above the 400 mark — Patna and Rajgir — where Women's Hockey Asian Championship Trophy is being held — Muzaffarpur, Saharsa and Bettiah also made it to the top 10 polluted cities list, as per a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin. A 24-hour average AQI of Hajipur's Industrial Area stood at 427 on the day, with the main source of pollution being PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter) or suspended particles in air, particularly silt. After Hajipur, Chandigarh was the second most polluted city with an AQI of 343, closely followed by Patna with 340 and Delhi at 334. Rajgir, where Women's Hockey Asian Championship Trophy is being held, was at fifth position, recording a ""poor"" AQI of 296.The state capital's air turned toxic in the last 24 hours, as the AQI level rose by 58 notches from a ""poor"" 282 on the previous day to a ""very poor"" of 340 on Tuesday. Of the six continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations located across the city, the one in Samanpura recorded the highest AQI of 389, followed by Patna City (353), Muradpur (326), Rajbanshi Nagar (325), DRM office-Khagaul (324) and Planetarium (320). The average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 145µg/m3 and 140.2µg/m3 respectively.According to CPCB, an AQI above 300 is deemed ""very poor"" and can affect respiratory health on prolonged exposure. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"" and 401 and 500 ""severe"". A ""severe"" AQI can even affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases. The other polluted cities in Bihar, which recorded ""poor"" air quality with AQIs above 200 were led by Rajgir (296), followed by Saharsa (294), Muzaffarpur (293), Bettiah (290), Samastipur (235), Araria (229), Purnia (224), Buxar (213) and Gaya (213).Environmentalists have attributed the pollution to airborne dust being trapped and subsequently pushed towards the lower layer of the earth. Given that surface winds are calm and stagnant, the dust particles remain trapped within the lower atmosphere for prolonged periods. Meteorological factors, including temperature, fog conditions, wind speed and direction, are also responsible for fluctuations in the AQI, besides other anthropogenic activities.Arun Kumar, a senior scientist at Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said localised dust is the main reason behind the rise in air pollution in Hajipur. ""The monitoring station is installed in the industrial area, and due to the continuous movement of heavy vehicles and meteorological conditions (calm wind below 5km/hr), the dust remains trapped in the air, hence the AQI level increased,"" he said.He added the pollution level increases after Chhath as the movement of vehicles on road increases. ""We are trying to control the pollution by taking localised measures.""Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh urged farmers to refrain from burning stubble in the fields, a major cause of air pollution, besides adopting scientific farming methods to increase productivity and income. Officials have been instructed to run awareness campaigns in villages about the subsidies provided by the state govt for agricultural equipment useful in crop residue management, relevant punitive provisions of the Indian Civil Code for burning stubble, soil and crop residue management, and environmental protection.Patna Municipal Corporation has been directed to regularly sprinkle water and mist on a regular basis in the areas where construction activities are going on to suppress the dust particles.,

 content=&lt;p&gt;Delhi: The trucks have lumbered through the capital for years, dumping loads of hot, acrid ash from thousands of tons of incinerated garbage close to playgrounds and schools.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Residents in the soot-stained homes nearby know what to expect: stinging eyes, constant migraines, hacking coughs of black spittle and shallow, labored breaths.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Burning the garbage was supposed to help solve one of Delhi's most startling environmental crises: the giant mountains of trash that soar nearly 200 feet into the air and eclipse the capital's skyline -- putrid, 20-story slopes of waste that collapse and crush people, or catch fire in noxious blazes that last for days.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The government pushed a revolutionary plan. It promised to incinerate the trash safely in a state-of-the-art plant, turning the waste into electricity in an ingenious bid to tackle two major problems at once.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Instead, the government's answer to its bursting landfills and boundless need for energy is exposing as many as 1 million people to toxic smoke and ash, according to air and soil samples collected by The New York Times over a five-year period.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Residents call it a mass poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Both the smoke billowing from the plant and the ashes dumped near homes have been found to be toxic, and Indian officials are well aware of the dangers.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Internal government reports found that the plant pumped as much as 10 times the legal amount of dioxins -- a key ingredient in the notorious Agent Orange herbicide deployed by the US military in the Vietnam War -- into the skies above Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Yet, the government has doubled down on its strategy nonetheless, breaking the law by dumping toxic ash right near homes and vowing to build similar facilities in dozens of cities where tens of millions of people live.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Having surpassed China as the world's most populous nation, India has nearly 60 cities with 1 million residents or more, making ""waste to energy"" plants such as the one in Delhi a model of what the government calls its ""Green Growth"" future.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The plant, run with one of India's biggest family business empires, even managed to get certified by the United Nations in 2011, earning the right to sell carbon credits on the global market because it uses trash, instead of fossil fuels, to generate electricity.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The problem is, many current and former workers at the plant say, there is nothing green about it.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;""The plant was never regulated, and the government knows,"" Rakesh Kumar Aggarwal, a former manager at the plant, told the Times before he died in 2020, months after we started reporting this article and collecting samples for testing. He said basic safety measures were routinely skipped to save money and emissions from the facility went untreated, spewing dangerous chemicals into the heart of Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;""On paper, it looks fine -- it's burning tons of trash each day,"" he added. ""But it's killing people.""&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Independent lab tests commissioned by the Times found that in the central Delhi neighborhood where the plant sits, the average amount of hazardous chemicals and heavy metals in the air drastically exceeded safety standards.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The Times collected about 150 air and soil samples from 2019 through 2023 around the plant, in neighborhoods where the ash was illegally dumped and in other parts of the capital. We worked with experts at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, one of the country's premier universities, to test the samples, and analyzed the findings with scientists at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Experts called the levels of heavy metals we found alarming. In all, as many as 1 million people live in what scientists considered the possible contamination zones.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;""I am the living example,"" said Shailendra Bhadoriya, a cardiologist who moved into a leafy neighborhood in 2011. He loved its proximity to good schools and parks for his young children, and wanted to be able to walk to work at the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, one of the largest cardiac hospitals in Asia, where he directed the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;He described watching the waste-to-energy plant being built about 150 yards from his home. Then, soon after it opened in 2012, Bhadoriya said, he noticed something worrisome: He and his family were constantly sick. His neighbors started to complain, too.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Within a year, Bhadoriya said, he and his daughter had become severely asthmatic, requiring frenzied visits to the hospital as they struggled to breathe. Outside, black soot spewing from the plant's smokestack fell from the sky like filthy rain, he said, coating parked cars, balconies and playgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Over the five years that the Times followed Bhadoriya, his health deteriorated significantly. He looked as if he had aged 20 years, his frame doubling over, his cheeks sinking in. His skin grew blotchy with dark spots and boils, possible signs of heavy metal and other chemical poisoning, experts consulted by the Times said. He and his daughter spent long sessions splayed out on the family couch, breathing through nebulizers, their eyes red and bulging.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am living a compromised life,&quot; said Bhadoriya. He knows he should move, he added, but he feels obligated to be close to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Neeta Mishra, a gynecologist who has lived and worked in the neighborhood since 1999, said she had watched birth defects and miscarriages rise in the community since the plant opened.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;I tell any pregnant patient to get out of this neighborhood,&quot; she said. &quot;When patients go away, they are better. When they come back, they are worse.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In one of the most unequal cities in the world, the problems stalk the wealthy and poor alike. The facility, named the Timarpur-Okhla Waste to Energy Plant, sits squarely in the center of the capital and burns as much as 3,000 tons of garbage a day, generating a small amount of electricity for a power-starved country.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Its smoke belches across sought-after neighborhoods that host some of the country's most prestigious hospitals, schools and even a Ferrari dealership. And despite rules that prohibit the ash from being dumped in residential areas, open-bed trucks -- often bearing the Delhi municipal government's logo -- have carted thousands of tons of incinerated trash to poorer neighborhoods on the capital's outskirts for years. The wind kicks up their uncovered loads along the way.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Many of the trucks have climbed to the top of a knoll overlooking hundreds of homes, a playground and a Hindu temple. From there, the soot has come hurtling down toward the neighborhood below in black clouds, seeping into homes and settling like a gritty blanket that coats just about everything -- floors, laundry, groceries, children's toys.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;The dust is like a bedsheet,&quot; said Rohit Mishra, 19, wiping down his desk and schoolbooks. Plumes of soot swirled in the air of his home. His mother sweeps and sweeps again -- a &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; of dirt and grime. Still, the family is plagued by hacking coughs of black phlegm, the color of their lives since the trucks started coming.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;There is so much ash that the government has even leveled it, with a school, a clinic, a wedding hall and a park built atop the poisonous ground. Incongruously, one of the dump sites is in an &quot;eco park.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;They say in the future, they will plant trees there, that it will be beautiful,&quot; Yashpal Singh, 45, said of the dump site that overlooks his neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Kafeel Ahmen, a neighbor, was skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will only be able to enjoy that garden if we are alive to see it,&quot; he said of the illnesses in his neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;When the plant opened, the government promised an innovative solution to a seemingly intractable problem. Delhi's trash mountains and landfills are so enormous that they spanned more than 150 acres last year, with waste weighing about 16 million tons -- the equivalent of more than 40 Empire State Buildings. Large birds circle the peaks like a scene out of the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The solution brought together some of India's most powerful players across business and politics. The Indian government partnered with a company controlled by the Jindal family, one of the nation's most prominent, with operations that stretch from coal mines in Australia and South Africa to steel plants in Ohio and Texas. The business school at the University of Texas at Dallas is named after one of the four Jindal brothers who help control the family businesses.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The arrangement was fairly straightforward: The company that runs the plant received land and the promise of a $2 million government grant to help build the facility. Delhi's municipal government supplies the plant with garbage to burn, and then the electricity gets sold back to the capital's grid.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The Jindal family empire struck the deal under the former government, and it continues to wield influence with the current prime minister, Narendra Modi. One of the Jindal brothers helped broker a rare meeting in 2015 between Modi and Pakistan's prime minister, an extraordinary encounter between leaders of enemy nations, officials involved in the event said. Another brother represents Modi's party in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The Modi administration has praised India's foray into burning trash for energy. In the nation's push to open more, the Jindal family's dizzying web of businesses, which often refers to itself as the O.P. Jindal Group, has been awarded several more plants, making it the biggest national player by far.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Turning waste into energy is not new. The technology is used in American and European cities such as Miami and Paris, where it powers the Louvre Museum. Many experts say the approach will only become more necessary as the world churns out ever more trash and landfills ravenously consume valuable land.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;But current and former workers at the plant in Delhi say that some of the basic steps needed to operate safely have been skipped from the very beginning for a simple reason -- to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Without the proper controls and oversight, they and other experts say, such plants are essentially open-pit garbage fires.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Thanos Bourtsalas, acting director of Columbia University's Earth Engineering Center, said he toured the Okhla plant in 2017 and quickly grew alarmed at how many of the basic precautions needed to reduce pollution were being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was very concerned by what I saw,&quot; said Bourtsalas, rattling off a litany of substances and steps needed to prevent toxic emissions that the plant had skipped.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;When I asked why they weren't using those materials, they said they do sometimes, maybe once every two weeks to save money,&quot; he said. &quot;These materials need to be continuously injected. They are the main systems to control air pollution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Despite Bourtsalas' concerns, the plant's website portrayed him as a fervent champion. A photograph of him still appears on it, right next to a quote in which Bourtsalas supposedly calls the plant a &quot;Great Step towards Sustainability&quot; -- an accolade he denies ever giving.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Bourtsalas said he was shocked to learn that he was on the website -- and that his warnings were being portrayed as an endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;I warned them that what they were doing was dangerous,&quot; he said. &quot;Repeatedly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The Jindal empire had promised a best-in-class path to green energy. Speaking to an Indian newspaper as the Okhla plant was being built in 2011, Allard Nooy, then-CEO of a Jindal-controlled subsidiary that oversees the plant, promised to monitor toxic emissions carefully.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will initiate those tests, hand to heart,&quot; Nooy was quoted as saying at the time. &quot;You have to appreciate that we are not a fly-by-night operator. We are the Jindals, India's fourth-largest conglomerate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Nooy did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Officially, the government was also regulating the plant to make sure it operated safely. But former workers said they regularly got tipped off when inspectors were coming, so that they could spin up the necessary safety measures before regulators arrived and make it look as if the plant always functioned by the book.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;We would get a notification from the pollution boards that they were coming and start using&quot; the necessary measures to mitigate emissions, said Aggarwal, the former plant manager.&lt;/p&gt;.India needs to usher in Green Revolution 2.0 to promote less water-intensive crops: GTRI.&lt;p&gt;&quot;But we never used it normally,&quot; he added, declining to say whether regulators had been bribed.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The deception came down to basic economics, managers said: The plant was not as profitable as expected.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;When a Jindal-controlled subsidiary got the contract in 2008, it seemed poised to cash in on an expansive international carbon credit market managed by the United Nations. The arrangement enabled countries and companies that wanted to offset their own carbon emissions to buy credits from other projects that produced renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;According to an internal assessment obtained by the Times, the plant could expect to make $2 million off the carbon market when it opened in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;But right before the plant came online, the market crashed.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the carbon credit market peaked at $176 billion. When the plant opened the next year, the market had lost nearly two-thirds of its value.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the plant's whole economic model had been upended.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the Okhla project was being developed, the carbon market was booming at that time; it was one of the revenue drivers for the project,&quot; said Neelesh Gupta, a former manager at the Jindal-controlled subsidiary that operates the plant. He resigned in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The market's collapse &quot;made the project unviable,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;So, the plant operators started cutting corners to save money, according to Bourtsalas, Aggarwal and two former senior employees. Managers stopped buying enough of the emission-cleaning materials needed to operate safely, they said.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Other vital precautions have been flouted as well, the Times found.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;For one, the &quot;consent to operate&quot; -- terms that govern the plant's operations -- makes it clear that the trash is supposed to be sorted first. That prevents potential hazards, including batteries, harmful plastics and electronic waste, from being burned and emitting heavy metals into the air.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;But as we followed the trucks from the plant to the dump sites and collected samples, we saw parts of batteries, pipes, wires, a melted cellphone and other obvious pieces of metal and electronics, suggesting that the plant was not sorting its trash properly before burning it.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, many of the ashes from incinerated trash are considered so toxic that most European waste-to-energy plants mix them with cement before transporting them, so they don't escape. They are then dumped in scientifically engineered landfills or giant cement vats designed to prevent them from getting into the soil and leaching into groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The Indian government appears to take none of these precautions.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;We watched Delhi municipal trucks drop truckload after truckload of loose ash right near homes, schools, a temple and a clinic, ignoring the rules that govern the plant and violating explicit orders by the nation's top environmental regulators to stop dumping toxic ash near residents.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In one neighborhood, Tajpur Pahari, apartment buildings surround a wide quarry about 60 feet deep, right next to the so-called eco park where residents gather to exercise, play and worship. Trucks from the plant poured ashes into the quarry for years, finally stopping in 2023 after they had filled up the cavernous pit.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;We took more than 70 soil samples from Tajpur Pahari in 2022 and 2023. The results showed that levels of cadmium -- a dangerous heavy metal often found in batteries -- were eight times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency's hazard limit, on average. We also found dangerous concentrations of lead in the soil.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;There was so much metal that impoverished families, known locally as ragpickers, sorted through the ash to salvage whatever they could, retching on the fumes as they worked. Covered in soot, they clutched dirty scarves to their noses as the trucks dumped steaming loads around them. They stepped back and let the ash cool before sifting through it with crudely made magnets, fishing out metal scraps to sell.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is not the place to dump; there is groundwater,&quot; said Tejdeep Singh, who retired in 2022 from India's Ministry of Water as a senior scientist after 34 years.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don't know who told them to dump there,&quot; he said of the eco park. &quot;But the country is run by bureaucrats, not the technocrats with knowledge.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;As the neighborhood woke up each day, residents crossed the small road to the dumpsite, power-walking around the park for their morning exercise. Commuters trudged through ash piles to get to work. By the afternoon, excited children streamed out of the schools to play cricket in the park.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Ominder Singh, who helped manage the Tajpur Pahari dump site for several years, said he always approached the fresh ash piles with caution, the acrid fumes giving him a gnawing headache that didn't go away. But he needed the job, he said.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look at this place,&quot; he said, motioning toward the ragpickers. &quot;Now you know what poverty means.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In another Delhi suburb where the ash has been dumped -- called Khadda Colony, where Rohit Mishra, the student, lives with his family -- our test results were similar. The soot from the trucks had spread so far and wide throughout the area that we took one sample off the hood of a parked car that had been completely covered in ash. It contained cadmium levels nearly four times the EPA threshold.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Amit Kumar, a spokesperson for Delhi's municipality, denied that any ash was ever dumped in residential areas, claiming it went to landfills instead.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;But we followed dozens of dump trucks from the Okhla plant over a period of three years. We watched them wend through the capital and drop loads in residential neighborhoods, only a few dozen feet from homes.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;To make doubly sure the ash had come from the Okhla plant, we asked the drivers to show us their paperwork, which bore the logo of a Jindal-controlled subsidiary and confirmed that their loads had come from the facility. Beyond that, managers at the dump sites said that only trucks from the plant were allowed to dump there.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Despite repeated requests for comment over several years, the nation's Ministry of Environment and the main environmental regulatory agency declined to comment. Jindal-controlled companies that own and oversee the plant, both directly and indirectly, declined to comment as well.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In March, the government opened Delhi's first scientifically engineered dump, enabling the capital to manage the ash in a safer way. But residents say the toxic ash from previous dumping still coats nearly every facet of their lives, and in July, they received a new shock: The government allowed the plant to ramp up its operations significantly, giving it the right to burn about 1,000 more tons of trash a day.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;More people could become sick,&quot; said Keeve Nachman, one of the Johns Hopkins scientists who helped analyze test results. &quot;Based on reports of various illnesses in the community, these health effects should be taken seriously.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The kinds of hazards that have been found in the plant's emissions can be long lasting. Dioxins continue to contaminate Vietnam's soil and rivers decades after the war there, with severe health consequences such as birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Desperate residents sued to stop the plant in India's Supreme Court, but the case has been delayed for years. They also wrote the United Nations to protest the carbon credits the plant was receiving, listing the ways in which the plant was skirting regulations. They say the U.N. ignored them.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;A U.N. spokesperson said it was the responsibility of the Indian government, not the United Nations, to ensure the plant was meeting environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Experts said the United Nations simply did not have the bandwidth to monitor the many companies whose supposedly green emissions made up the carbon credit market. Buyers eventually discovered that many projects, including in India, were not actually environmentally friendly, contributing to the market's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Indian regulators also said they had their hands full. The Central Pollution Control Board, the nation's top environmental regulator, employs a staff of about 400 to monitor a country of about 1.4 billion, compared with the EPA in the United States, which employs nearly 17,000 for a nation with roughly one-fourth as many people.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of things should be done,&quot; said Deepak Kumar Singh, a director at the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the main environmental regulator for the capital and its surroundings. &quot;The frequency of monitoring should be more, inspections of the plant should be more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;But, he said, the city's problems stretched far beyond the Okhla plant. Delhi is the world's most polluted capital, with only a handful of days each year considered in the &quot;healthy&quot; range by air quality experts.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have to understand,&quot; Singh pleaded. &quot;We have three scientists monitoring air and water pollution for all of Delhi's industries,&quot; making it all but impossible to adequately regulate one of the biggest, busiest cities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Many experts contend that the government is worsening -- and at times actively hiding -- the problem. Dismayed by India's reputation for having dozens of the world's 50 most polluted cities, the government has not only added layers of red tape that make it harder for researchers to test the capital's air quality, but it has harassed and arrested environmentalists for raising concerns, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Judges and regulators have occasionally thrown obstacles in front of the Okhla plant over its environmental breaches, but not for long.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;A 2015 ruling by the National Green Tribunal, India's top environmental court, found that the data released by the Okhla plant &quot;seems to not be representative of actual emissions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Two years after that, the tribunal ruled against the plant again for continuing to violate regulations, but allowed it to keep running.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Also in 2017, India's Environment Ministry hired experts from the German government's development agency, known as GIZ, to evaluate the plant.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In an internal report obtained by the Times, the German experts found that the plant was emitting harmful toxins and not monitoring emissions properly, echoing the tribunal's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;The plant violated the permitted emission limit values during consideration most of the time,&quot; the report said.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The hulking facility was originally built to churn out 16 megawatts of electricity but sought to expand. India's Environment Ministry initially thwarted the request, citing concerns that the plant was not monitoring its emissions accurately; that it was too close to residential neighborhoods; and that residents had complained that it was releasing dangerous amounts of pollutants into the air.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Residents argue that, given the plant's egregious safety record, it should be shut down. But to them, the government seems more concerned with the aesthetics of Delhi's trash mountains -- considered a national humiliation -- than with the sicknesses ripping through their families.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Boils and cuts speckle the hands of Varna Sri Raman, possible signs of dioxin poisoning, according to experts consulted by the Times. An economist and writer of children's books, Sri Raman said she can barely type on her computer to work on research papers or the children's tales she loves writing.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Sri Raman and her husband had purchased their home in the neighborhood of Sukhdev Vihar, thinking that the bird sanctuary next door would provide some relief from Delhi's infamous smog.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;But now we have this toxic monster that is breathing this stuff out, choking us everyday,&quot; Sri Raman said. Her garden rooftop overlooks the plant, about 100 yards away.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Her 11-year-old son has had severe, persistent bronchitis since he was 2, when they moved to the neighborhood, she said.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you speak to my son, he'll say he has had a bad cold since 2018,&quot; she said, adding that nebulizers have become a crutch in their household, as they have for many neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The trash kept getting burned, even as violations piled up. In March 2020, regulators found the Okhla plant was releasing three times the permissible limits of dioxins and furans, another toxic substance.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Then in September 2020, regulators found that the problem had gotten worse: The plant was emitting 10 times the permissible limit of dioxins and furans.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Even so, the government has continued to bet on the Jindal empire, promising it about $12.5 million in government grants to build a second plant in the capital -- and backing it with great political fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2022, as one of the family-controlled businesses inaugurated its second waste-to-energy plant in Delhi, an extremely powerful politician, Amit Shah, the home affairs minister and right-hand man of Modi, gave the opening speech, lauding the effort to get rid of Delhi's trash mountains, a major voter concern.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The economic landscape for these waste-to-energy plants has also changed. A Jindal-controlled subsidiary sold more than $400,000 of carbon credits in 2022 from its waste-to-energy plants, according to the company's financial statements, and it may cash in on more in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Despite the carbon market's collapse a decade ago, it is now booming once more, rising to $949 billion in 2023, up from $277 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In September, the U.S. government issued its first-ever federal guidelines for investing in carbon credits, which is expected to boost the market. China opened up a carbon credit market this year, and India is seeking to create its own.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;Money is flowing through these markets, but it's very difficult to measure how much of it really ends up financing climate action, or to make sure the green projects are really green,&quot; said Gilles Dufrasne, a policy expert on global carbon markets at Carbon Market Watch, a watchdog.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Sri Raman believes the Okhla plant is slowly killing her family, but she feels trapped. The family invested its life savings in the house and would have to sell at a huge loss. The neighborhood is now infamous for two things: the Okhla plant and the sick people around it.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Last year, an explosion shook one of the plant's boilers and ash rained down on her neighborhood for 24 hours, she and other residents said.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Although protests were once common against the plant, the government has clamped down on all demonstrations in Delhi in recent years. The neighborhood is mixed, Muslim and Hindu, and the government's Hindu-nationalist agenda has often pitted the religious groups against each other across India, making it harder to join together to stop the pollution, Sri Raman and other residents say.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;The state that this country is in right now, it's impossible to get Hindus to join with Muslims to fight,&quot; Sri Raman said. &quot;But Jindal's pollution doesn't affect me any different than a Muslim mother.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;We both need to protect our families, to live,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;,

 description=Ola Electric's S1 X 3 kWh and S1 X 4 kWh scooters received certification for the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme. The company is now the sole two-wheeler EV manufacturer to achieve PLI compliance for four products. The certification underscores Olas manufacturing strength and commitment to India's EV vision, with shares increasing by 4.4% on this news.,
 content=Ola Electric's S1 X 3 kWh and S1 X 4 kWh scooters have received certification for compliance with the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for the automobile and auto components sector. This certification, awarded by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), comes after Ola Electric successfully met the minimum localisation criteria of 50% as mandated by the Ministry of Heavy Industries. The company stands to receive incentives ranging from 13% to 18% of the determined sales value of compliant products for up to five consecutive financial years starting from Fiscal 2024.With this Ola Electric has become the only EV maker to get PLI compliance certification for four products: S1 Air, S1 Pro, and S1 X models in both 3 kWh and 4 kWh versions. The S1 Air received PLI certification earlier at the Auto PLI Conclave held in January 2024.Following this announcement, shares of Ola Electric rose by 4.4% to INR 143.8 in Wednesday trading on the BSE.A spokesperson for Ola Electric Mobility commented, “S1 X 3 kWh and S1 X 4 kWh together contribute to almost half of our revenues, and with the PLI now in place, we will be able to further improve our bottom line. Receiving the PLI certification for the premium and mass-market products affirms our vertically integrated manufacturing strength marking a significant achievement in advancing India's EV vision. The government's ambitious Auto PLI Scheme is poised to enhance local supply chains, foster domestic manufacturing, and assist companies in achieving economies of scale.”The PLI scheme, unveiled by the government in 2021 with a budgetary outlay of INR 25,938 crore, aims to boost domestic manufacturing of Advanced Automotive Technology (AAT) products and attract investments in the automotive manufacturing value chain. The scheme focuses on Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), such as Battery Electric and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles, by providing financial incentives to automobile OEMs and component makers.In another significant milestone, Ola Electric was awarded a 20GWh capacity allocation under the PLI scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery storage in March 2022. This allocation entitles the company to receive incentives under the Cell PLI scheme for five years, starting from the commissioning date of the Ola Gigafactory in Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu.The certification from ARAI followed comprehensive testing and verification of component localisation. Ola Electric's achievement in meeting the stringent localisation criteria highlights the company's commitment to fostering domestic manufacturing and advancing India's electric vehicle vision. The PLI scheme's support is expected to enhance local supply chains and foster economies of scale, providing a significant boost to the country's EV sector.The PLI approval for Ola’s scooters comes months after the government’s flagship FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) subsidy for the EV industry expired in March. The subsidy was replaced by the leaner Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) from April 1.On August 5, Union Heavy Industries Minister HD Kumaraswamy said preparation work is going on for the implementation of the new FAME 3 subsidy, and multiple ministries have sent in recommendations on how to implement the programme.,

 description=A Pollution-under-Control certificate or PuC is mandatory for all vehicles in India. And all it takes to get one is 10 minutes of your time.,
 content=Delhi pollution levels have once again turned toxic and while several factors contribute to the worsening AQI or air-quality index in the capital city, vehicles here often have to share a fair chunk of the blame. Tailpipe emissions from engine-powered vehicles cannot be entirely eliminated but there are permissible limits which are ratified by Pollution-Under-Control (PuC) certificates which are mandatory for all.Did you know that over 54,000 vehicles were fined for having expired PuC certificates in just two weeks in Delhi? As officials in the city crackdown on polluting vehicles, now is the right time to check if your vehicle has a valid PuC, a move that can save you big bucks.(Also read: Is your car choking you? Five tips to drive clean)What is the fine amount for expired PuC?Delhi Transport Department has intensified its monitoring efforts to apprehend vehicles on the move but minus a valid PuC. The penalty for any vehicle with an expired PuC is a fine of up to ₹10,000. A vehicle may even be impounded in certain conditions and the owner of the vehicle imprisoned for up to six months in the worst of instances like repeat offences.How to obtain a valid PuC?Getting a PuC requires very little effort and time. And of course, it can save you from the hassle of coughing up big bucks in fines, if caught. There are scores of PuC centers spread across the length and breadth of Delhi and elsewhere as well. Drive or ride into any one, share your mobile number, provide the OTP receieved and that is it. Once you receive a valid PuC, you need to pay a checking fees which is typically around ₹150 for private cars and ₹100 for private two-wheelers. The PuC is mostly valid for a year from the time of the inspection.Can your vehicle fail PuC test?If tailpipe emissions are higher than the permissible limit, a vehicle will fail the check. There is no penalty for this and no requirement to pay the test fees. It is, however, up to the owner of the said vehicle to get the vehicle checked as a service center to ascertain and fix the cause.Tailpipe emissions can be high due to a plethora of factors, ranging from dirty fuel injectors, faulty ignition system and worn out spark plugs to faulty oxygen sensor. Do also note that any damage to the silencer of the vehicle will result in the vehicle failing the PuC check.It is strongly recommended that in case a vehicle fails a PuC check, it is taken to a competent service center for a through check and fix.,

 description=None,
 content=&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is a national emergency that&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;silently poisons the air we all breathe. While the issue is often framed as a ‘North Indian’ problem, with cities like&nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/india/delhi/delhis-air-quality-slips-back-to-poor-with-aqi-at-233-3308014""&gt;Delhi grabbing the spotlight&lt;/a&gt;, the deeper truth is that this crisis is rooted in inequity across all of India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The poorest and most marginalised — children, the elderly, outdoor workers, and those with pre-existing health conditions — are left to inhale the most toxic air, often with no escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inequity doesn’t stop there. Air pollution is only acknowledged as a crisis in the northern cities, leaving the rest of the country to suffer in silence. Cities across India, face the serious toxic levels of pollution, yet the conversation remains disproportionately focused only on the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just a battle for cleaner air — it is a struggle for social justice. A crisis that ignores the people who are most affected by it, and a crisis that treats the health of citizens in one part of the country as less urgent than those in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toll on vulnerable communities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, air pollution was linked to a total of 709,000 deaths in children under five years old, according to the&nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://www.stateofglobalair.org/resources/report/state-global-air-report-2024""&gt;2024 State of Global Air&lt;/a&gt;. Women, already burdened with caregiving, often suffer more from pollution, deepening inequality. Air pollution is linked to&lt;a href=""https://healthpolicy-watch.news/air-pollution-reproductive-health-women/""&gt;&nbsp;higher rates of miscarriages, pregnancy complications, and stillbirths&lt;/a&gt;, affecting women’s reproductive health. The elderly with their weakened immune systems and people with chronic ailments like asthma, COPD, or heart disease are&nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://www.lung.org/research/sota/health-risks""&gt;especially vulnerable to exacerbated symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, often facing the added challenge of inadequate access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most overlooked group in the conversation about air pollution is the millions of outdoor workers who spend long hours exposed to the very toxins that put their health at risk. These workers, often from lower-income backgrounds, do not have the luxury of staying indoors to avoid polluted air. Whether they work at construction sites, street vendors, or delivery personnel, like every other environmental crisis, they are also at the frontlines of India’s air pollution crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarming NO2 problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is a silent epidemic that is slowly choking the life out of our urban centres. While the media often shines its spotlight on Delhi's toxic air,&nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-india-stateless/2020/01/aeef07e3-airpocalypse-iv.pdf""&gt;80% of Indian cities&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;are suffering in silence, breathing air that fails to meet even the most basic health standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest findings from&nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/publication/17085/beyond-north-india-tackling-no2-pollution-and-health-risks-in-seven-major-indian-cities/""&gt;Greenpeace India report&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;reveal a stark reality; 89% of Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring (CAAQM) stations across seven major Indian cities — Pune, Mumbai, Kolkata, Jaipur, Hyderabad,&nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/bengalureans-breathed-high-concentration-of-toxic-gas-no2-in-2023-3303930""&gt;Bengaluru&lt;/a&gt;, and Chennai exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO)’s annual health-based pollution guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Satellite data over the past five years shows a consistent increase in the annual average NO₂ concentrations across all seven cities. The situation is more dire in cities like Pune and Jaipur. In these cities, NO₂ concentrations exceeded healthy levels on more than half of the days in 2023. In Pune, a staggering 95% of days saw air quality readings above the recommended limits. These rising concentrations further deepen the inequalities faced by already vulnerable populations, underscoring that air pollution is not just a northern issue but a national emergency that demands urgent attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the government's response remains sluggish. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) have not been revised since 2009. This regulatory stagnation only exacerbates the public health threat, leaving millions to breathe air that is not just harmful but potentially life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inequities in air pollution are further compounded by the fact that poorer communities lack the resources to mitigate environmental harm. This is a profound issue of environmental justice.&nbsp;Air pollution is not only a health issue but a deeply entrenched inequality issue, where those with the least power, income, and access to decision-making are the ones who face the most devastating effects. The root causes of air pollution are deeply intertwined with urban planning and industrial policies that prioritise short-term economic growth over the long-term health and well-being of citizens, particularly those who are already disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate ticket&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective and long-term strategies to address the crisis of air pollution, especially in rapidly growing urban centres, is the strengthening of public transportation systems. Public transport offers a dual benefit. It can reduce vehicular emissions, which are a major source of NO₂, while also providing safe, affordable, and accessible transportation options to those who are most affected by pollution. An efficient, reliable, affordable, and accessible public transport system is key to addressing this issue effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes will not come easily. They require a concerted effort from both the government and urban planners to prioritise clean, sustainable, and equitable transport solutions. Public transit must not only be expanded but also made affordable for all. Without accessible transport options, vulnerable communities will continue to be trapped in polluted environments, unable to escape the health risks that come with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To break this cycle, a transformative approach is needed — the introduction of a ‘Climate Ticket’&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;in public transportation could be a game-changer. This would offer discounted fares on public transportation to encourage more people to use cleaner and more sustainable options. By incentivising greater use of public transportation through initiatives like the climate ticket, we can reduce traffic congestion, lower harmful emissions, and drastically improve air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coupled with a bold commitment to the phase-out of fossil fuels, these actions also confront climate change head-on. Together, they create a pathway toward more sustainable, inclusive cities — where cleaner air, reduced emissions, and equitable urban mobility become a reality for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Selomi Garnaik is a campaigner at Greenpeace India, where she works on campaigns of air pollution and climate justice.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the author's own.

 description=Winter air pollution, worsened by temperature inversions and increased fossil fuel use, severely impacts lung health. Particulate matter and toxic gas,
 content=The increase in respiratory illnesses that are often associated with winter conditions is partly due to seasonal air pollution. Air quality tends to deteriorate when temperatures are low, particularly during the interplay of climatic conditions, increased fossil fuel use, and natural events like temperature inversions. The following paper investigates the impact of winter pollution on lung health, particularly on vulnerable populations, and what might be done to mitigate these effects.116244755Understanding winter pollutionWinter air pollution is mainly caused by particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Most of the phenomena that characterise winter bring about the trapping of pollutants close to the ground in a phenomenon known as temperature inversion whereby warm air is piled above cool air, not allowing pollution to disperse with the resulting poor air quality.The additional sources of emissions, apart from this, include the consumption of biomass and fossil fuel for heating purposes and other industrial emissions. In metropolitan areas, the vehicular emissions and construction activities sum up the issue. Both of these add up and contribute to high levels of dangerous pollutants that affect lungs badly.Impact on the lungsWinter pollution is highly harmful to the lungs. Fine particulate matter causes inflammation and oxidative stress through penetration into the lungs, even deep enough to enter the bloodstream. Short-term exposure to air pollution causes irritation in the airways, coughing, wheezing, and breathing difficulties.Winter pollution is particularly challenging for people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, COPD, or bronchitis, as it tends to worsen symptoms and causes frequent exacerbations. Long-term exposure may reduce lung function and increase the risk of chronic respiratory diseases and even lung cancer.Vulnerable groups include children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. Children have more delicate lungs that are easily injured by pollutants, and old people suffer worsening of their underlying respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.Reduction of riskEven though it is impossible to eliminate air pollution completely, several steps can reduce the impact:Monitor air quality: Track the local air quality index and schedule outdoor activities during less polluted hours.Utilize masks and air purifiers: HEPA filters can significantly minimize exposure to particulates via masks and purifiers.Steer clear of outdoor activity When Pollutants Are at Peak: Typically, peak hours of pollution occur early morning and late evening in winter. Steer clear of doing intense outdoor activities during these periods.Promote indoor ventilation: Although closing windows reduces pollutant entry, poor ventilation can further deteriorate indoor air quality. Consider using exhaust fans or air purifiers indoors.Advocate for cleaner practices: Supporting policies that reduce vehicle and industrial emissions, promote public transportation, and discourage biomass burning can improve air quality in the long run.The problem of winter pollution and its impact on lung health is that it requires a multi-faceted approach. Beyond individual precautions, there is a need for systemic changes in the form of stricter air quality regulations, cleaner energy sources, and public awareness campaigns against pollution. From a clinical standpoint, timely interventions will go a long way toward reducing the burden of exacerbated respiratory conditions during winter. Working together as individuals, communities, and policymakers, we can work towards cleaner air and healthier lungs not just during the winter months but throughout the year.,

Best Overall: Coway Airmega True HEPA Purifier
Tester: Nashia Baker, senior commerce editor
My space: Overall, my space has pretty standard air quality—I typically like opening my windows for some circulation, but it’s less ideal during the changing seasons when dust and allergens get inside from the trees in the area. With wildfire smoke recently circulating the New York City air, any added protection with an air purifier is a major plus.
Area coverage: This air purifier is designed to clean spaces up to 874 square feet, and I can confidently say that it does its job well. I usually place it right in the middle of my home to circulate through the space, but since some areas of my home are more tucked away, I also like to move it to specific spots that could use some extra love.
Filter replacements: Replacement filters cost $70. The manufacturer suggests replacing the HEPA carbon filters every 12 months to remove odors and gases from the air.
My experience: I’ve been using this air purifier for the last few months, and its quality is second to none. First off, the setup was simple. Coway’s included printed instructions were easy to follow, and after placing the HEPA filter inside, the hard cover snapped in place seamlessly. The HEPA filter itself has a four-stage filtration design: Pre-filter, Deodorization filter, True HEPA filter, Vital Ion. I’ve appreciated this thorough filtration process since it’s made to capture up to 99.97% of even the smallest of particles, like pollen and allergens that can come in my space during spring blooms.
Like the Coway Airmega 250 Smart Air Purifier Mafi tested below, this air purifier turns on quietly. So much so that I can hardly tell it’s on most of the time. While it comes with three speeds to help thoroughly clean the air, I always keep the air purifier on auto mode. This is a favorite feature of mine, as it automatically detects the air quality through three LED light modes: blue (good), purple (moderate), and red (unhealthy). Whenever there’s a change in the air quality, like if I’m cooking, the LED light adjusts to either purple or red and the air purifier picks up its speed to quickly regulate it. Usually in just a matter of minutes, the LED light changes back to blue and the air purifier goes back to a whisper-quiet sound. When the purifier doesn’t detect any air pollution at all for half an hour, it’ll automatically switch into eco mode, which is an amazing tech feature for energy savings.
Lastly, the overall design of this air purifier is a big standout for modern spaces. Since this is a slightly bigger home appliance (larger than a standard space heater but much smaller than an HVAC), I didn’t want it to be an eyesore in my space. I have it in the white colorway, but you can shop it in the black too.
The bottom line: Coming in at less than $250, I highly recommend this air purifier to anyone who is looking for powerful air cleaning qualities, great smart technology, and a more affordable option to shop. It was bigger than I expected, but thankfully it comes with a hidden carry handle that makes it easy to move around my space. Like most air purifiers, this one has a corded design, so just make sure you have an outlet handy wherever you place it in your home.
Tester: Nick Mafi, senior features editor
My space: Luckily, the air quality in my home is pretty good and I don’t smoke nor do I live with any animals. I will say that I live in Brooklyn and my windows face a street. So, naturally, some dust from the street does find its way into my apartment.
Area coverage: My apartment is 814 square feet and I have the air purifier unit located in the center of the apartment, next to a wall. At this size, the purifier can and does cycle and clean the air that spans the entirety of the space. (It can clean air in large spaces up to 930 square feet.)
Filter replacements: New filters cost about $79 and replacing the pre-filter (the first of four filters) is very simple. You simply pull the washable pre-filter out of the device, clean it, allow it to properly dry, then slide it back into place.
My experience: My experience with the air purifier to date has been a very good one. When turned on, it is very quiet. This is important because I typically turn the unit on while having friends over for dinner. I do this to create an extra level of protection in my apartment during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the noise level of the product is important, so as not to drone out people speaking at the table. Fortunately, it’s not an issue with this machine. The design of the product is great too. It almost looks like a fancy, sort of futuristic speaker. In fact, it’s turned into a bit of a dinner table conversation, as people often don’t immediately guess that it’s a purifier.
In terms of the technology, Coway’s unit has a four filtration system, which in and of itself is kind of incredible. I mean, how often do we get four layers of protection for anything? The first layer is for the larger dust particles or pet hairs. Then, the second layer involves capturing the small particles that made it through. The third layer is carbon activated, which means it can extract carbon dioxide and other harmful chemicals from the air. The fourth and final layer involves the capturing and containment of viruses and bacteria.
In terms of smart features, I was impressed with how I could control everything from the tap of a button on my smartphone. The app also allows me to set a timer for the duration that I’d like the purifier to stay on, while also providing a detailed report on the air quality in real-time.
The bottom line: I would recommend this air cleaner to anyone who is in the market. At this time, when clean air in your home is so important, this air purifier is a must for those who can afford it. I think the fact that this filter involves four layers of protection, and that the fourth actually contains and extracts 99.999% of viruses and bacteria is phenomenal. All the more so that it can do it in the midst of a global pandemic. And as we are starting to learn how to “live” with the pandemic as part of our daily lives, having a state of the art air purifying system is all the more important. By paying $350, you are providing you and your family the safety and security to invite friends and family to your house, with much needed peace of mind too.

My space: I have pretty intense dust and fragrance allergies and I work from home a lot these days with a large dog in an old building. It’s not an exceptionally dusty space, but we live on a block with a decent amount of car traffic and I’m pretty much always obsessing about the air quality. If I start sneezing or waking up with a sore throat, I want answers!
Area coverage: The Humidify+Cool is meant to work in a single room at a time (it was previously tested by Dyson in an 81 cubic feet chamber), and I placed it in my bedroom, which is the smallest room in my home.
Filter replacements: Filter replacements cost $79.99 and it’s recommended that they be replaced once every year. Installing them initially was quite quick–they snapped into place fairly easily.
My experience: It’s rare to find a machine that can purify your air, humidify it, and cool down a space all in one–so I was impressed right off the bat. An update to earlier Dyson models, this machine does all that and aside from getting rid of the usual particles, it also removes formaldehyde (which can cause even more irritation to your eyes and throat) from the air.
The Humidify+Cool has a HEPA filtration system and a separate carbon filter detects formaldehyde. I guess it could be due in part to my obsession with clean air, but, so far, the Dyson has reported good air quality every time I’ve checked in–the only exceptions being after I’ve lit candles or cooked something on the stovetop. But when the air quality has dipped below ideal levels, it doesn’t seem to take much time for the purifier to do the job once I turn up the fan speed (it should be noted that this model also has an auto purify setting that will kick into high gear if the quality dips, but it is a little loud for my taste so I tend to keep it on a lower setting).
While I hate having an app for literally every device in my home, installing the Dyson Link app really did make installation a snap. And I love being able to check in on the air stats (temperature, particle level, humidity level, etc) whenever I want. You can also control the fan speed, oscillation range, and set timers from the app.
As for specific features I appreciate, filling the water tank from the top is a huge plus and it’s large enough that it doesn’t have to be refilled every day. I also appreciate the night mode setting, which makes everything a little quieter and less bright.
What I would change: This may be a misconception about the purpose of a humidifier, but I am used to really intense humidifiers that emit visible plumes of moist steam all night long. This is not that. The humidity that the Dyson model generates in the house is definitely a healthy and reasonable level (most sources recommend 30–50% humidity, and the Dyson, at its max humidity setting, hovers around 60%), but if you are like me and want more targeted humidity in the super dry winter months, this is not the machine for you and you might want to stick to separate devices for purifying, humidifying, and cooling.
The bottom line: Aside from the note above, this is a really expensive device, coming in at more than $800. That said, it might actually save you money in the long run if you don’t want to buy a purifier, a fan, and a humidifier individually and you want a powerful device for each activity. I’d recommend it if you have deep pockets and not a ton of challenging air pollution situations to combat on the regular.

My space: I have allergies and live in an old building that generates dust easily, so I am very sensitive to air quality. This makes me particularly focused on reducing allergens and dust in my living space; especially in my bedroom, which is smaller and where the air is noticeably less fresh.
Area coverage: The Clorox Smart Medium Room Air Purifier is designed for medium-sized rooms. It works best in spaces up to 1,000 square feet, but it can clean the air up to five times per hour in a room as small as 225 square feet, which is ideal for my needs.
Filter replacements: In terms of replacement filters, the Clorox 12030 Medium Room Replacement Filter is what’s recommended and should be replaced every 6 to 12 months. It’s straightforward to swap out, ensuring the air purifier runs at optimal efficiency.
My experience: The purifier runs quietly, which is a bonus for using it in a bedroom like I do. It has a three-stage filtration system with a 360° design, including a True HEPA filter that captures 99.97% of allergens and particulates, along with viruses and bacteria. I especially appreciate the smart features, such as Alexa voice integration, which allows me to control the device with my voice or the app. The real-time air quality feedback with a color-coded display is also incredibly useful. Overall, the Clorox air purifier has performed exceptionally well in reducing dust in my space—I’ve even noticed that I don’t need to vacuum as often.
The bottom line: I recommend this air purifier, especially to those with allergies or concerns about dust and air quality in their homes. It’s effective, smart, and well worth the price for peace of mind and fresher air.

The space: I got our home’s first air purifier back in 2018, hoping it would help scrub the air of some pollen and pet dander (first a Molekule Air Pro, then adding an ALEN Breathesmart to the mix). Then 2020 hit. By the summer of 2020, we had six or seven air purifiers running in the house at all times. Today, most of our air purifiers have been donated, and I’m back to being primarily concerned with pollen, pets, dust, and smoke (a problem that is only going to get worse in the foreseeable future) when it comes to indoor air quality.
Area coverage: The A3 Ultra Quiet is rated to fully refresh the air in a space measuring 1,030 square feet, twice per hour. Though do note that, as with all air purifiers, its effective coverage size is considered to be smaller for allergy sufferers.
Filter replacements: You can buy filter replacements here for just under $100. While many air purifier filters need to be swapped out every six months, this one can last up to two years.
My experience: My first thought on powering on the A3 is that Rabbit Air isn’t kidding then they say this air purifier is quiet. In fact, when set to a “silent” operating speed, it’s literally quieter than a whisper. And at night, thanks to a built-in light sensor, it reduces its lights (which can change color to represent air quality in real time) fading away into a dim, barely-audible device one could easily forget was even there.
In terms of actually using the device, it’s an easy setup and familiarization process. You can pretty much start using it right out of the box—all you need to do is discard the packing materials and then pop the front panel off the air purifier, exposing the filters inside that need to have protective film removed. On the control panel, you will find air quality indicators, filter status info, and your Wi-Fi connectivity status.
Because this is a fully smart air purifier that you can control remotely in real time via a phone or tablet app, you can also get all the info you’d ever want about your indoor air quality via the Rabbit Air app, available for download at both the Google Play and Apple app stores.
The bottom line: When the Rabbit Air A3 is running, the air in your home will be cleaner—you can count on that based on the intense testing and product comparisons the company runs, not to mention the five-year warranty offered. You can also tell the air is cleaner because it will smell that way, and I don’t just mean a reduction in unwanted odors (though that’s a welcome fact here)—I mean you will literally experience the odor of fresher air, much like going outdoors on a clear, breezy day.

The space: I tested my kitchen’s air quality using an air quality monitor. In this case, the lower the CO₂ score, the better. According to the monitor, a score of less than 500 parts per million (ppm) CO₂ is good for indoor air. Anything between 500–599 ppm is considered okay, and anything higher than 599 ppm is poor. I periodically tested the kitchen, my guest bathroom full of houseplants, and my office where I have no houseplants.
Area coverage: This air purifier is excellent for single rooms, especially high-traffic rooms like the kitchen or living room.
Filter replacements: You can buy replacement filters on Briiv’s site.
My experience: Every day for two weeks, I turned the Briiv on level four at 8 a.m., and over the first 30 minutes the air quality rating became an average of 387 ppm (well within good indoor CO₂ levels). After keeping the device on level four until 10 a.m., the air quality score reached 350 ppm and leveled out (I also took the extra precaution of making sure all the windows and doors were closed throughout the test).
I even tested the air quality in the evenings after making dinner, when I would turn the device on again at the lower setting of one dot. The CO₂ levels then became an average of 472 ppm. As a comparison, an MIT report suggests that atmospheric CO₂ levels of between 280 and 350 ppm is a good score outside. My bathroom with houseplants scored 407 ppm, and the room without houseplants at all scored 520 ppm.
Given its hefty price tag, it was vital to me that the Briiv lived up to the hype. So I put the device through the ringer, spending weeks with it and going so far as to buy an air quality monitor to check in on how my Briiv was doing at purifying my home’s air. What I found was that the device seemed to bring down the CO₂ levels in my kitchen and did away with funky smells. It’s important to note that the Briiv doesn’t include any air quality indicators, so there’s nothing on the device itself to convey that anything was happening, which is why understanding the science behind the key—and its beautifully biophilic—ingredient of moss can help.
In navigating the Briiv air filter, I could manage the touch-activated control zone on the front of the device or utilize the app (available for Apple or Android). The control zone is very simple, so I stuck with that. It has a range of one to four dots indicating the level of fan speed available. One dot of speed is barely audible, two dots is a bit louder and offers a buzzing sound, while the latter strengths of three and four dots are even more pronounced—mimicking the sound of the average tabletop fan. Next to this scale is a touch button for a one-hour boost, a cleanse mode that will clear up a room’s air in just an hour.
The bottom line: The Briiv worked better than I imagined. Not to mention, there’s an advantage to owning a Briiv that other air filters can’t offer: It’s a wonderful feeling having moss in the home. It almost feels like it is answering a subconscious need to commune with nature, even indoors. And based on looks alone, the device certainly adds to any countertop. It is on the pricier side, so interested buyers will have to determine if the gentle air purifier that also works to help the planet is worth the buy.
Although definitely not scientific, my findings show the Briiv can circulate and clean the air in a high-traffic area, my kitchen, where I also routinely cook and thus emit fumes indoors. But it does take the device some time to cycle the air in the room entirely, and the higher levels do seem to perform better in terms of thoroughly cleaning the air. I also noticed the air felt more refreshing when using the device, and I didn’t feel that middle of the afternoon stuffy head feeling from allergies in spring.

My space: My living situation is absolutely rife with dust: I live in a century-old apartment building right next to an elevated subway track with two wonderful cats, and their not-so-wonderful litter boxes. Our gas stove is hood-less and sits right next to our gas-powered washer-dryer. Beyond all of that, my partner and I have a penchant for buying dusty antiques nearly every time we leave the city.
Area coverage: The Blue Pure 411i Max is optimized for “small spaces,” touting a suggested range of 219–526 square feet. I tested it in my 13x13 living/dining room (which clocks in well below the maximum square footage).
Filter replacements: Blueair offers 2 options for filter replacements: A single filter for $39.99, or a two-pack with a replacement subscription for $50.98. Each filter lasts 6-9 months, and the Blueair app alerts you when it is time to switch over to a new one.
My experience: I hate downloading apps onto my phone. And I especially hate appliances that are rendered useless without their accompanying app. Thankfully, the Blue Pure Max 411i works its magic with or without it (the app is an optional addition for some extra functionality).
In the app (I downloaded it for testing purposes), you can create a schedule, set the purifier to automatically switch modes at different times of the day, set a “child lock,” and change the brightness of the LED display (a perfect feature for people with purifiers in the bedroom). Beyond changing settings, the app gives an overview of the level of air pollution in your space and alerts the user when it is time to change filters. While I can’t say I’ve noticed a palpable difference in the quality of the air in my apartment, I’m sure the HEPA filter is removing plenty of imperceptible pollutants. That peace of mind is good enough for me!
What I would change: In a perfect world, I would be able to find a purifier that blends in with my collection of midcentury furniture, rather than one that screams “I AM AN AIR PURIFIER”—but alas. When it comes to aesthetics, the Blueair models are totally fine, and better than most–they’re sleek and minimal, and likely blend in more easily with modern decor.
For a purifier specifically aimed at small spaces, the Blue Max 411i is not exactly miniature. At 19 inches tall, with a 10-inch diameter, it’s a tad bulky, especially when placed in an optimal location for purifying.
The bottom line: Overall, I am very happy to have this purifier in my space! In the age of global pandemics and unpredictable environmental factors, we can all stand to benefit from some cleaner air. Though slightly bulky, the Blue Max 411i is extremely easy to use, relatively affordable, and almost completely inaudible. For me, it’s a fantastic set-it-and-forget-it air quality solution!
Coway Airmega 100
Tester: Lila Allen, associate director, AD PRO
My space: As long as I’ve lived in New York City, I’ve struggled with a general feeling of ick around my home. Dust, pollen (especially during open-window season), and pollution from traffic have all been challenges. And with a cat in the mix, there’s also pet dander, fur, and litter box odors to contend with. Diligent cleaning gets me pretty far, but doesn’t resolve all of these issues.
Area coverage: This model covers up to 810 square feet in an hour. I focused it in one area of my home—the bedroom—where pet odors and pollution were the biggest blights.
Filter replacements: A replacement filter runs just shy of $40. Filters last for up to a year, and Coway recommends vacuuming them periodically. I didn’t need to replace mine during my testing window, but it’s very easy to swap out whenever it comes time—you just flip the unit upside down, untwist the top, pull out the old filter, and slide in your new one.
My experience: The Airmega 100 runs right about the size of a breadbox, at 15 1/2"" tall and a diameter of 8 3/4"". The cylindrical body (which intakes air from all directions) is inoffensive, if slightly conspicuous—it’s solid white, with functions integrated into a touchpad on a black top. An indicator detects particulate matter down to 2.5 microns, telling you about the state of your space in real time and illuminating blue when air quality is good, green when it’s moderate, orange when it’s unhealthy, and pink when it’s very unhealthy (which thankfully I never saw!). Airflow can adjust automatically based on air quality by using the device’s “Smart Mode.” If you’re bothered by glowing lights at night, good news: This model offers an amber-hued “night light” setting, or you can turn off lit features entirely.
I tested this model over the course of about six months and definitely noticed a reduction in pet odors and dust during that time. (Bragging rights: I was told that the dust and dander in my room was “not bad at all” for someone with a cat by my movers this summer! I attribute that at least in part to this device.) The Airmega uses a three-stage system, with a vacuumable pre-filter, a HEPA filter, and a deodorization filter combining to clean and de-stinkify your room.
The bottom line: This was a great product, and I think the price (around $130 at full retail) is fair for what you get. I’ve used other air purifiers where I’ve had to change filters all the time, so having one where I could “set it and forget it” was a plus. This unit is a solid option for someone living in an apartment and dealing with similar issues—mold, pollution, pet dander, and so on—or looking to neutralize some less-than-pleasant funk in a small to medium-sized space.

My space: No matter how much I dust my bedroom in my apartment, the wooden floors always seem to get dusty the next day. I live with two other roommates and my bedroom is attached to a hallway that we all are constantly walking through to get to the bathroom or the laundry area. I’ve realized recently that having a bedroom near a “high traffic” area of the apartment may be the culprit behind my dust issue, especially if people are walking through after having been outside.
Area coverage: The effective range of the air purifier is 403 square feet and can be used in larger areas, however purification will take longer. I used it in my bedroom, which is approximately 12 feet by 13.
Filter replacements: The filter replacements for this particular model cost around $50. I haven’t had to replace my filter yet since it lasts about 12 months. However, when you first take the air purifier out of its delivery packaging, you have to remove the filter from a plastic covering and place it back in the purifier. I found this process super simple since all you have to do is twist the bottom portion of the purifier off, remove the filter, put the cleaned filter (or a new one) back in, and then twist the bottom portion back on.
My experience: After about a week using the air purifier in my bedroom (along with regular dusting), I noticed that I wasn’t waking up with puffy eyes anymore. This may sound cliché, but the air in my room felt crisper and definitely cleaner. I specifically liked the Auto Mode feature that adjusts the fan settings automatically based on the current air quality in the room. I also appreciated the Sleep Mode feature that keeps the air purifier operating quietly by using an ultra low fan speed, this way I could use it throughout the night without the sound disrupting my sleep. I found it interesting that this air purifier has a 3-Stage Filtration system: the first is a pre-filter that captures larger particles such as dust and pet fur, the second is a H13 True HEPA filter that “captures at least 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 microns in size,” and the third is a custom high-efficiency activated carbon filter that absorbs smoke, odors, and fumes. Each of these filters also serves the purpose of maximizing the filter’s life which I find makes this purifier a good investment.
I was also impressed with other high-tech features such as the VeSync app, which allows you to control the air purifier from your smartphone by connecting it through Bluetooth. Having access to the app allows you to easily view the air quality in the room you have the air purifier set up in with words like “good” or “very good.” You can also view the air purifier’s filter life, as well as set up features such as “Auto Clean,” which turns the air purifier on automatically when the air quality is bad and “Auto Stop,” which automatically turns the air purifier off when the air quality is good. I also found it helpful that the app lets you view how long you’ve had the air purifier running as well as how much air has been purified. You can visibly see the job getting done!
For someone who really isn’t that tech savvy, I found everything to be easily accessible. Sometimes products add all this extra tech just as a bonus, but I truly felt that each and every tech feature that this air purifier had to offer was functional and beneficial.
What I would change: One downside of this air filter is that it’s definitely on the larger and bulkier side and you definitely need to have the space for it, especially since the manual recommends keeping it 15 inches from anything surrounding it.
The bottom line: Overall, I found this air purifier very effective! I would recommend this specific product to anyone who is looking for more of a high-tech option that will definitely get the job done. However, you definitely have to have the space for it, as it is not a sleek and sexy option compared to other air purifiers on the market that are on the pricier side.
Tester: Sydney Gore, senior digital design editor
The space: My allergies have always made me a sensitive person in regards to air quality, but it wasn’t until I got sick from the smoke that spilled into New York from the Canada wildfires that I was pushed to invest in an air purifier. My apartment gets dusty despite all my efforts to keep it clean and that’s a much smaller space compared to an entire house in the suburbs—in addition to me and my parents, we have two cats and their fur gets caught on every surface.
Area coverage: The dimensions of this model are 17.72 x 10.05 x 18.86 in and it was specifically designed for larger spaces to circulate and filter room air in a 310 square foot space. I set this up in the family room on the first level of my parents’ house since it’s an open floor plan and that zone gets the most foot traffic, especially from our cats.
Filter replacements: Replacement filters for the HPA204 series will run you around $25 with the recommendation to replace filters annually (though I haven't gotten around to replacing mine just yet, it seems fairly simple to do so).
My experience: My parents have always had Honeywell air purifiers around the house, which I didn’t notice until recently, so that felt like a strong indicator for me to trust the brand—they’re true to this, not new to this. The setup is pretty simple, but I unboxed everything to make sure that my parents would be good to go on their own when I’m not around. Within the first few days of using the HPA204, I felt like the air quality in that section of the house had improved. (We get a lot of dust and other miscellaneous particles downstairs so you can usually hear a lot of sneezing.) After three months, my dad actually likes this version more than his older Honeywell products so he has since moved it upstairs into his bedroom (a very strong endorsement)—I wouldn’t be surprised if he ordered more of them for the rest of the house. Also, the cats don’t seem to mind when it’s on and they’re the toughest critics out of all of us!
Honeywell’s True HEPA Air Purifier uses an activated carbon pre-filter to help capture large airborne particles and reduce odors and VOCs. The filtration helps capture up to 99.97% of the following microscopic airborne allergens and particles: Dust, pollen, pet dander, dust mite debris, and smoke. It has three cleaning levels (high/medium/low) with a turbo setting that is supposed to be excellent for people with allergies, so essentially our entire household. I especially appreciate the silent operation and dimmer option, this is critical in the evenings.
The bottom line: Honeywell is an OG air purifier and air conditioner brand, I would highly recommend any of their products. Did I forget to mention that they offer a five year warranty? Doesn't get classier than that. Also, this model earned the ENERGY STAR label by meeting strict energy efficient guidelines set by the U.S. EPA so seems pretty legit! The Gore family swears by it, what other approval do you need?
Molekule Air Pro
Tester: Steven John, contributor
My space: We have two cats that shed heavily and we often burn candles. We also cook most every meal at home, and while the range is vented, invariably some gas enters the air, as it does from our natural gas-burning fireplace in the winter.
Area coverage: The Molekule Air Pro is rated to cover 1,000 square feet of space in homes with eight-foot ceilings. Our ceilings are nine feet on the main floor, so we used our Molekule in tandem with another air purifier, setting it up in a den right of the kitchen. We placed another air purifier from a different brand in the living room, but the Molekule did the heavy lifting with gas and fumes to contend with.
Filter replacements: The Air Pro’s replacement filter is quite pricey, at $174.99 for a one-time purchase or $139.99 with a subscription, and the company recommends replacement every six months. Changing the PECO-HEPA Tri-Power filter is very easy, at least: It involves a quick rotation and lifting up on the top of the unit and then just popping the filter out.
My experience: Perhaps my favorite thing about each air purifier that Molekule has released is the fact that they are aesthetically pleasing. So many air purifiers are large, clunky, and are just general eyesores. This one is sleek, tall and slim, and almost artistic. I also always appreciated how quietly it worked, remaining at something like a steady whisper even at higher power. The PECO-HEPA Tri-Power filter caught dust and particles with great efficacy, reducing the amount of dust in our den, kitchen, and adjacent hallways, and I always loved how the air coming out of the Air Pro literally smelled cleaner; it smelled faintly sweet, the way pure oxygen does. Frankly, the only change I wish could be made to the Molekule Air Pro is a reduction of the high cost of the replacement filters. Even with a regular subscription, they’re expensive, and that subscription may not even meet the timing you actually need in your home.
The bottom line: I would strongly recommend the Molekule Air Pro air purifier to anyone who wants cleaner air and is concerned with aesthetics. If someone had a place they could put their air purifier totally out of sight, then I would have to recommend one with lower priced replacement parts, though.

My space: I’m always looking for ways to protect myself from anything that could flare up my eczema and dust allergies, but once pollen gets thrown into the mix, all bets are off. While I do a pretty good job of catching the visible aggressors with dusting and vacuuming around my house, it’s difficult to monitor microscopic allergens and airborne contaminants, so I’m usually left sniffling or itching during transitional seasons.
Area coverage: Dyson’s Purifier Hot+Cool is great for medium to large rooms and can easily cover an area of up to 315 square ft (2860 cubic feet) if not more, according to tests conducted by Dyson. I kept mine in my bedroom, which is about 170 square feet.
Filter replacements: Filter replacements run about $80 from Dyson, though cheaper alternatives do exist from outlets like Amazon (just know these off-brand versions have been reported to work to varying degrees). The filters easily snap into the chamber-like base of the purifier and Dyson recommends replacing your filters when you’re alerted by the app or every 12 months, whichever comes first.
My experience: In addition to a small remote control, there’s also the Wifi-enabled Dyson Link app, which you can download to your smart device. I usually detest having to download an app to get the most out of my tech and appliances, though the Link app made setup a breeze; plus, if you own more Dyson home products it’s easy to manage them all in one place.
The purifier itself works like a dream, and I noticed within a week of use that I felt noticeably less congested. The intuitive device uses a 360° filtration system that implements a combination of activated carbon to remove potentially harmful gases and odors from the air and a HEPA H13 filter to capture 99.97% of particles. I appreciated that the Hot+Cold has an auto mode, which continuously monitors room temperature and indoor air quality, while also running the fan or heat to the degree of your choosing.
When you first turn on the purifier, it immediately starts assessing the surrounding air quality, and you can monitor any fluctuations in general air quality, particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), particles smaller than 10 microns (PM10), volatile organic compounds usually from air sprays or aerosol (VOCs), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as well as temperature and humidity. I was particularly fond of this feature and frequently looked at these charts to see how the levels would rise or decrease over long periods of time.
Visually, the Dyson purifier definitely grabs attention with its sleek, modern design—a big draw to me when incorporating it into my space. Noise was never something that bothered me, though it emits louder sounds when the fan/heater is on a higher level or if it’s working to clean the air in a more polluted space. Besides its impressive air purification skills, the device doubles and triples as an oscillating smart fan and heater with adjustable airflow which I became hugely hooked on during winter (on account of some drafty windows in my room). With the ability to set your desired temperature, the heater can make a closed space feel noticeably warmer in very little time (my room size is average and I would say it took under 10 minutes).
The bottom line: I really love this air purifier because I can feel and see it working (via the app). At $650 a pop, this air purifier is definitely a splurge. Are there other air purifiers out there that work just as well at a lower price point? Probably—but I would say it’s the combination of a high-quality air purifier, fan, and heater that make this one worth its price.

How to check your air quality
There are three primary ways to check your air quality. If you want to go the free route, you can use your phone’s built-in weather app to check the AQI (Air Quality Index) of your location. It won't be exact, especially if your windows are closed, but it's an okay estimate. For a more specific air quality reading, you can purchase an air quality monitor (we found a bunch on Amazon starting from $36). Otherwise, if you have an air purifier already, there’s a good chance it has a screen or connected app that will tell you the CADR rating (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of your space.
You might not know that there are actually a handful of different kinds of air purifiers. The primary aim of each is the same: to filter out allergens, mold spores, smoke, VOCs, and other particulate matter. You can find UV purifiers, which use ultraviolet rays to sanitize surfaces. There are also activated carbon, ionization, and HEPA air purifiers—the last of which is most common for personal use.
Most of these machines are on the smaller side and only purify one room, while other air purifiers work larger spaces. Some HEPA purifiers come with a carbon filter, and vice versa. In fact, many different types of air purifiers use HEPA technology.
Now that you know some of our favorite air purifiers, it’s your turn to go shopping. Whether you stick with one of our top picks or branch out, these are the things we recommend keeping in mind when choosing an air purifier.

Consider the area coverage. 
Not all air purifiers are created equally. While some devices like the My Happi are designed to purify small rooms, others (like the Coway’s AirMega series ) are designed to cover up to 930 square feet. Before you buy an air purifier, consider where you're going to be using it. That will help you pick the right air purifier for your space.
Look for top-tier filtration systems.
The most important thing about any air purifier is how well it filters the air. The gold standard is the HEPA filter. So, what is a HEPA filter? According to the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency, HEPA stands for “high efficiency particulate air"" and any filter with this designation can trap 99.97% of particles like dust, mold, and pollen that are 0.3 microns. According to Coway, HEPA air filters were originally created to capture radioactive particles during atomic bomb tests in World War II. Today’s HEPA filters—usually made out of maze-like, interlaced glass fibers—are used to trap air contaminants like dust, mold, and pollen.
Factor in the cost and frequency of air filter replacements.
Replacing your air filters when it’s time is crucial in ensuring your air purifier is performing at its highest efficiency. We’ve outlined the cost and process of replacing filters for each of these units—from the more cost-effective Blueair to the splurge-y Dyson—but strongly recommend you check out the cost to maintain your air purifier before hitting “add to cart.”
Choose an air purifier with several speed options.
As you can imagine, more air in your home will be filtered when you keep your air purifier on a higher fan speed, so keep an eye out for options in the market with multiple speeds. However, the EPA notes that boosting the amount of time your air purifier runs will also help increase air filtration.
Last but not least, find an air purifier that will blend with its intended surroundings.
The main factor in any air purifier is, of course, how well it cleans your home air. But ideally, you can find a low-profile, well designed air purifier that will fit your home aesthetic (it will, after all, be on display).

We had our editors and writers live with their air purifiers for at least one month in order to gauge the full effects of each device. When selecting products we took into account factors such as size, coverage range, design, and price (including long-term costs of replacing filters). We also inquired within our testing pool about their current environments and how they hoped an air purifier would improve their home life. Several of our reviewers live with pets, have asthma or allergies, or were hoping the devices would keep areas like the kitchen and bedroom fume-free.,

I’m writing this as the first heat wave of 2024 is moving into New York City. The mid-June heat dome is expected to cause temperatures in the hundreds. It won’t just be uncomfortably hot, but also a serious health issue for many. It’s a paradox that while the use of air conditioners is a contributor to global warming, they are a necessity in our overheated world.,

 publisher=https://www.enelgreenpower.com/en,
 description=Learn all about environmental pollution: what it is, types, main causes, the effects on human health and the planet, and global and individual actions to reduce it.,
 content=In the 1958 short story La nuvola di smog (The Smog Cloud), the Italian author Italo Calvino described an imaginary city wrapped in, as the title suggests, a large cloud of smog: pollution here becomes a metaphor for everything bad in life.
It is a literary account that demonstrates how environmental pollution has, since the second half of the twentieth century, entered collective consciousness as one of the major problems that characterize our time.
&nbsp;
What is environmental pollution
Environmental pollution is the introduction of foreign and potentially harmful elements into the environment. The consequences are particularly important when they damage ecosystems and human societies, especially with regard to health.
Pollution is not a human prerogative: volcanoes, for example, also emit pollutants. It is, however, certain that our species is contributing massively to environmental pollution, and this has increased over the past centuries.
&nbsp;
Types of pollution
There are different types of pollution.

The first to be studied were those in which pollutants had physical elements: air pollution, water pollution and land pollution.&nbsp;
Later, by analogy, definitions were provided for noise pollution, light pollution, thermal pollution, and electromagnetic pollution: in these cases, no material substances are introduced into the environment, but intangible agents – such as electromagnetic waves (including light) or sound – are.
&nbsp;

Often the different types of pollution interact with each other: for example, some pollutants in the atmosphere fall back to earth in the form of acid rain, thereby contaminating soils and oceans.
&nbsp;
Air pollution
Air pollution is the most prominent case. The most visible phenomenon is smog (a portmanteau word, a combination of “smoke” and “fog”), formed by gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide.
Even when it cannot be seen, however, pollution is both present and harmful. In the long run, the most dangerous pollutants are the greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide), which are responsible for climate change. The air in our cities is also polluted by other gases (such as carbon monoxide) and atmospheric particulate matter (i.e., fine particulate matter), which can be classified into PM10 (particles smaller than 10 microns in size) and PM2,5 (smaller than 2.5 microns).
Finally, the air is often polluted inside homes as well, due to cigarette smoke, insecticide sprays, and especially, in many countries, kitchens with ovens fueled by coal or other highly polluting fuels.
&nbsp;
Water Pollution
Water pollution now affects virtually all the world's seas, oceans, lakes and rivers. In the sea, the most egregious cases are oil spills from shipping disasters, but the problem of pollution from plastics and particularly microplastics is becoming increasingly urgent.
Fresh water accounts for only 2.5% of all water on Earth – it is the most precious resource for human life. Very often, however, running water is contaminated with chemicals, particularly those known as PFAS (Perfluorinated and Polyfluorinated Alkyl Substances).
&nbsp;
Soil Pollution
Pollution, along with erosion, is now the main threat to soil on our planet, and it has now reached every corner of the world: it has even been found in the most uninhabited areas, such as Antarctica.
Soil pollution is caused both by macroscopic objects such as waste left by humans and by substances that are present in the form of microscopic and therefore invisible particles.
&nbsp;
Electromagnetic pollution
Electromagnetic fields are often of natural origin: for example, the Earth's magnetic field, or the electric field generated by lightning. Today, however, we speak of electromagnetic pollution when the causes are human: even if they do not contaminate the environment with harmful substances, they still alter the natural conditions on the planet.
This is the case, for example, with broadcasting and telecommunications equipment (including cell phones), which are in fact designed to emit electromagnetic waves.
&nbsp;
Light Pollution
Since light is transmitted as electromagnetic waves, a special case of electromagnetic pollution comes in the form of light pollution. Artificial lighting systems often emit excessive brightness into the environment due to inefficient lamp design, so light is not concentrated downward, on streets or where it is most useful, but is scattered in all directions.
In addition to depriving urban dwellers of stargazing, light pollution makes astronomical observations problematic and, above all, it interferes with the life cycles of many animals.
&nbsp;
Noise Pollution
Like light pollution, noise pollution is also caused by human activities that do not emit material substances into the environment but waves, in this case sound.
This mostly affects city dwellers (e.g., in nightlife districts) but also, in general, anyone living in areas with a high density of road, rail or aviation traffic, as well as in industrial areas. And, as is the case with light pollution, noise pollution also creates more or less severe disturbances for many animal species.
&nbsp;
Thermal Pollution
Last but not least, thermal pollution occurs when human activities affect the environmental temperature. The effect is direct when heat is emitted: for example, water poured by many industries into waterways. It isn’t necessarily polluted but is at a high temperature.
Heat pollution is indirect when the increase in heat is a consequence of other activities: e.g., deforestation, which reduces the cooling effect of vegetation, or overbuilding, so much so that we speak of an &quot;urban heat island&quot; in cities, where the temperature is significantly higher than in surrounding areas. In the long run, the most worrisome indirect consequence is climate change triggered by greenhouse gases.
&nbsp;
The main causes of pollution
Virtually every human activity produces some form of pollution.

The oldest economic activity, agriculture, today makes extensive use of substances such as pesticides and fertilizers, which are among the main contributors to soil and water pollution.
Industries, and especially large factories, are a major source of air pollution due to gaseous emissions, but also, with their solid and liquid wastes, soil and water pollution. Furthermore, they are among the main contributors to noise and thermal pollution.
The energy sector has historically relied on fossil fuels, which are among the main contributors to climate change. Today the contribution of renewable sources is increasing, but in many countries, such as China, the use of coal, the most polluting fuel, is still predominant.
Another significant contributor to the greenhouse effect comes from transportation, but it also emits other polluting gases, such as carbon monoxide produced by vehicular traffic. Moreover, transportation is one of the leading causes of noise pollution.
Waste – industrial waste but also waste produced by individuals – has a major impact on the environment, especially if it isn’t managed properly. At a local level, landfills are a major source of soil pollution, while on a larger scale so is waste (such as plastic) that reaches the sea via waterways.

&nbsp;
The effects of environmental pollution
Environmental pollution has a harmful effect on human health.
According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, air pollution is responsible for 7 million premature deaths a year due to respiratory, cardiovascular, and immune system ailments. The damage caused by polluted indoor air must also be taken into consideration.
Water pollution is so widespread that nearly two billion people, or a quarter of the world's population, drink contaminated water on a daily basis.
Furthermore, pollutants such as waste from the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries, when dispersed into the environment, cause an increase in bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
Climate change also means an increase in extreme events such as cyclones, floods and drought.
On a planetary scale, the most lasting effects of environmental pollution are on biodiversity, so much so that there is talk of a new mass extinction that is already underway. The main causes, alongside intensive hunting and fishing, include climate change, but all other forms of pollution, from soil pollution to plastic contamination in the oceans, as well as thermal, noise and light pollution, also contribute to a lesser extent.
&nbsp;
The Global SCENARIO
While smog used to be associated with more developed metropolises such as London, over the past 10 years or so air quality in European cities has improved, as European Environmental Agency (EEA) data attest – although exposure to so-called fine particulate matter remains a problem – while it is very precarious in cities in developing countries.
Rivers in Asia are also often highly polluted, such as the Ganges (India), the Citarum (Indonesia), the Buriganga (Bangladesh), and the Huang-Ho or Yellow River (China). It’s difficult to rank them with unambiguous criteria, but the River Sarno in the Italian region of Campania also appears in many of these rankings.
With regard to marine pollution, the &quot;Great Pacific Garbage Patch&quot; (which covers an larger than Australia) in the North Pacific is famous, but similar phenomena can be found in other oceans: these are marine areas where, due to currents, microplastics accumulate in abnormal concentrations (although they aren’t visible to the naked eye).
&nbsp;
How can we reduce pollution?
Reducing pollution is possible; it is something that is being done at an intergovernmental level, for example, with the many climate summits, despite sluggishness and uncertainty.
In actual fact, companies are setting goals that go beyond institutional ones: in the energy sector, the most advanced companies are moving to an electricity generation fleet increasingly based on clean sources, which are now fully competitive, thanks to technological innovation, particularly in materials science.
The Enel Group is a major player in this field, and we are setting our sights even higher: our new Strategic Plan for 2024-2026 allocates €12.1 billion of investment for renewables, with the goal of adding another 13.4 GW of renewable capacity by 2026, bringing the total to 73 GW. We thus expect that our share of zero-emission generation will rise from 74% in 2023 to 86% in 2026, reaching 100% by 2040.
Renewable energy is part of the more general framework of the circular economy. This approach isn’t limited to the simple practice of reuse and recycling, but also involves extending the useful life of various products and making them circular from the design stage onwards. This cuts down on waste generation and reduces pollution related to the extraction of raw materials.
Another improvement we are seeing is electrification in areas such as heating, cooking, and transportation. This is decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality in cities and homes.
Moreover, compared to the situation some time ago, even internal combustion vehicles are now less polluting. This is due to technological innovation, as well as fuel diversification.
At a local level, there are an increasing number of actions being taken by governments, especially in more developed countries, particularly to reduce traffic and encourage sustainable waste management.
Individuals and communities can also play an important role in reducing environmental pollution: for example, by favoring travel by public transportation (especially rail), paying to the sorting of waste, reducing energy consumption, as well as, of course, avoiding dispersing plastics or other polluting materials into the environment.
The responsibility is everyone's, the importance is paramount and the mission is possible: namely, to curb all forms of anthropogenic pollution to protect human health, natural ecosystems and the environment in general.

 content=HYDERABAD: My seventh grade-Environmental Science book said there are five types of pollution — air, water, land, noise, and light. Now, as long as humans are breathing and making sure that breath reaches the office on time, we can never do anything about air pollution. Either our lungs will evolve into air filters, or some genius will start selling lung implants in a “Buy 2, get 2 free” combo with breasts. Water and land pollution don’t even make headlines. Forget headlines. We know air pollution is measured by AQI, but how are water and land pollution measured? Only Sadhguru knows, since he claims to have fixed it all during his rally for rivers.We’re actually fine with noise pollution, to be honest. Most of us are so busy trying to mute our violent inner voices that a truck honking loudly feels like music to our ears — literally!And then there’s light pollution — one form of pollution we could fix in seconds by pressing an off button. I thought Lit AF was a concept that existed only in the comments sections of GenZs instagram accounts until I passed by a few buildings in Hyderabad. Since there is no regulation around the brightness of the lights, many buildings in the IT offices zone look like lighthouses trying to help an imaginary ship navigate. And if you pass by hitech city, it feels like lighthouses are for sale.They say a city never sleeps. That’s because it never turns off its lights.Sure, let’s agree we need streetlights, traffic signals, and basic illumination so Edison’s hard work doesn’t go to waste. But explain this — why does Junaid’s Tuition Center in Mehdipatnam have lights so bright that it feels like God himself is teaching inter-second-year chemistry? And why is Deloitte’s building glowing like it is Diwali everyday? Most of their employees are working from home, and even if they weren’t, shouldn’t the lights inside be on? These lights do nothing but mark territory in the air so that clients visiting the office from the USA can see the office from the plane itself.Malls shut at 11 pm but their lights stay on all night. Why? So that owls and bats can do a little window shopping?   There’s an over-lit juice shop next to the club where I perform regularly, and trust me, more guys have asked the juice shop owner if stag entry is allowed than they’ve asked the actual club bouncer..There is a pharmacy in Banjara hills that blinds you with its sign board so much you have no option but to walk into the pharmacy and buy some eye drops.I could also give you real reasons to care about light pollution — sleep disorders, wildlife confusion, wasted energy — but let’s be honest, no one’s paying attention until Netflix makes a documentary about it (they actually did but we don’t care).Why can these guys just do what we do at home — the last one switches off the lights. It’s not a NASA mission; it’s a switch. Our phones have dark modes, so why can’t buildings?And office buildings? Let’s be real — if your only visitors are employees, stop glowing. Who are you trying to guide — the Zomato guy? He’s got GPS.I understand air pollution is trending but I’m sure light pollution will be in the news one day. That day I want to be the guy who said I told you so.(The writer’s views are his own).Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest,

 content=The Supreme Court on Thursday (December 12) directed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to continue the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage-II restrictions in Delhi along with certain measures from GRAP III such as water sprinkling, mechanized road sweeping, enhancing public transport and restricting entry of interstate buses.A bench of Justice Abhay S. Oka and Justice Augustine George Masih allowed the CAQM's proposal to implement  GRAP Stage-III measures within Stage-II to takle air pollution. The Court issued an order stating that the directions in its previous order dated December 5, 2024, would remain in effect until further orders.“Regarding applicability of stages of GRAP, directions contained in paragraphs 8 and 9 of our last order dated 5th December will continue till further orders. We approve the recommendations of the subcommittee which are mentioned in the note submitted by CAQM on 11th of December 2024. The Commission will now proceed to implement the modified GRAP”, the order stated.On December 5, the Court reviewed AQI data from November 18 to December 4, 2024. It noted that until November 30, AQI levels were consistently above 300 but had dropped below 300 in the subsequent four days.The Court had allowed the relaxation of GRAP Stage-IV restrictions to Stage-II but emphasized further monitoring. It directed that Stage-III measures must be reintroduced if AQI exceeds 350, and Stage-IV measures reinstated if AQI surpasses 400 on any given day. This order is to continue till further orders.During the hearing today, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, representing the CAQM, submitted a note detailing recommendations aimed at mitigating pollution. The proposed measures included:Further intensify the frequency of mechanised sweeping of roads.Ensure daily water sprinkling along with dust suppressants, before peak traffic hours, on roads and right of ways including hotspots. heavy traffic corridors and ensure proper disposal of the collected dust in designated sites/ landfills.Further intensify public transport services. Introduce differential rates to encourage off-peak travel.Do not permit Inter-State buses from NCR states other than EVş/CNG/BS-VI diesel, to enter Delhi (excluding buses /Tempo travellers operated with All India Tourist Permit).During the hearing, the Court noted that the AQI is still fluctuating. Bhati emphasised that the reduction if AQI is primarily due to favourable metrological conditions. She said that the Commission was not seeking to go below GRAP Stage-II at this stage.Amicus curiae Aparajita Singh argued for a proactive approach, stating that authorities should implement the next stage of GRAP before AQI thresholds are breached, instead of awaiting court orders.“Crop burning has contributed majorly to it and when crop burning happens, Delhi is already polluted, and it tilts over. Now hopefully the weather gods are with us but as your lordships have already directed them that before we reach the threshold, they should impose the next stage rather than wait for court orders.”On December 2, the Court had observed that it would allow the relaxation of GRAP-4 restrictions only after seeing a consistent downward trend in the Air Quality Index (AQI).Case no. – WP (C) 13029/1985Case Title – MC Mehta v.

 content=NEW DELHI:  The United Residents Joint Action (URJA), a consortium representing over 2,500 Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) in Delhi, has penned a letter to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) urging the central government to prioritise tackling the worsening pollution crisis in the ongoing parliamentary session.The letter expressed deep frustration over the lack of focus on Delhi-NCR’s pollution emergency, particularly as the region grapples with severe air quality under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) IV since early November 2024. URJA criticized political leaders for engaging in “brazen politics” at Delhi’s borders and within Parliament instead of addressing the environmental disaster. “It is worrisome that our political representatives choose to create a playground of commotion and chaos, while being blind to the realities of the present pollution crisis,” URJA stated in its letter. “The Parliament is in session, and our political representatives have not cared to either raise, debate or discuss the pollution crisis facing Delhi/NCR,” it said.The group highlighted the detrimental impact of large political gatherings and road blockages on pollution levels, pointing out the failure of authorities to regulate such events. “GRAP guidelines are silent on large public movements and gatherings within Delhi NCR and on interstate borders, thereby exposing the double standards of implementing authorities,” the letter further noted. Calling for urgent action, URJA outlined key demands, “Political representatives must send a clear message to the public that pollution in Delhi/NCR is being taken seriously. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) must take strict action under the CAQM Act, 2021, against any organization or group disrupting normal traffic flow through mass gatherings.”“GRAP IV should be implemented rigorously without becoming a tool for targeting individuals through fines and penalties,” it added..Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest,
